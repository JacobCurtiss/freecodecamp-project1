        <p>Keanu Reeves was born on September 2, 1964, in Beirut, Lebanon, and was raised in Toronto, Canada. 
            He first gained attention for his performance in River's Edge, while the comedy Bill & Ted's Excellent 
            Adventure and its sequel, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, brought him major recognition. Reeves has developed 
            an eclectic film roster that includes the action flick Speed and the sci-fi blockbusters The Matrix and 
            its sequels, as well as more art-house fare like My Own Private Idaho and The Private Lives of Pippa Lee. 
            Reeves made his directorial debut in 2013 with Man of Tai Chi.</p>
